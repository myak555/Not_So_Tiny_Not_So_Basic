Current functionality implemented and tested:
	(+) signifies change additions to original TinyBASIC fork;
	(-) feature removed;
	(*) feature reworked / rewritten;
	(/) feature unchanged.

(*) Major rework of expression handling. Now supports 7 levels of operation priority (TinyBASIC has only 4):
	1(*) unary + and -, numeric entry, functions and brackets; functions can handle multiple parameters, e.g. POW(2,3);
	2(+) a power b as a**b;
	3(*) division, multiplication, (+)remainder as %;
	4(*) addition and subtaraction;
	5(*) comparisons, such as A != 6;
	6(+) logical NOT;
	7(+) logical AND / OR, such as 17 <= A AND A <= 34 AND NOT B.

(*) FILES [folder_name] - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD. Optimized for small screens.
	Other statements can execute in the same line. Bug that prevented FILES to work after LOAD is fixed.
(*) CHAIN [folder_name/]file_name - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD.
(*) LOAD [folder_name/]file_name - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD.
(*) SAVE [folder_name/]file_name - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) LIST [from_line][, to_line] - rewritten, optimized for small screens, added from and to options.
	Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) MEM - refactored, optimized for small screens. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(/) NEW - unchanged.
(*) DELAY milliseconds - refactored.
(*) AWRITE pin, value - rewritten, now checks pin availability to prevent clash with SD, XMEM, SCREEN.
(*) DWRITE pin, value - rewritten, now accept TRUE and FALSE as values.
(*) TONEW frequency, duration - rewritten.
(*) TONE frequency, duration - rewritten.
(/) NOTONE - unchanged.
(*) EFORMAT - rewritten. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) ELIST - rewritten. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) ECHAIN - rewritten.
(*) ELOAD - rewritten.
(*) ESAVE - rewritten. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) RSEED value - rewritten.
(/) RUN.
(/) LET var = value.
(/) IF expression.
(*) GOTO line_number - refactored. Negative line numbers are not allowed.
	Computing GOTO, e.g. GOTO 100+10*I is not allowed (results in ugly programming practices).
(*) GOSUB line_number - refactored. Negative line numbers are not allowed.
	Computing GOSUB, e.g. GOSUB 100+10*I is not allowed.
(/) RETURN.
(/) REM <any_text>.
(/) FOR var=<from> TO <to> [STEP <step>].
(/) NEXT var.
(/) INPUT var.
(/) PRINT string/expression.
(*) POKE address, value - rewritten.
(*) PEEK( address) - rewritten.
(/) END.
(/) STOP.
(/) BYE.
(*) ABS(expression) - refactored.
(*) AREAD(pin_number) - refactored.
(*) DREAD(pin_number) - refactored.
(*) RND(expression) - refactored.
(+) SHOW(line_number) - prints one line, returns address.
(+) DUMP(address, n_bytes) - prints memory dump.
