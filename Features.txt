Current functionality implemented and tested:
	(+) signifies change additions to original TinyBASIC fork;
	(-) feature removed;
	(*) feature reworked / rewritten;
	(/) feature unchanged.

(*) Modified input: capialization is no longer necessary, e.g. FOR A=0 TO 3 and for a=0 to 3 are treated the same

(*) Modified variables; on Arduino MEGA double and float are the same 4-byte numbers; ESP32 has double precision 8-byte.

(*) Major rework of expression handling. Now supports 7 levels of operation priority (TinyBASIC has only 4):
	1(*) unary + and -, numeric entry, functions and brackets; functions can handle multiple parameters, e.g. POW(2,3);
	2(+) a power b as a**b;
	3(*) division, multiplication, (+)remainder as %;
	4(*) addition and subtaraction;
	5(*) comparisons, such as A != 6;
	6(+) logical NOT;
	7(+) logical AND / OR, such as 17 <= A AND A <= 34 AND NOT B.

(*) FILES [folder_name] - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD. Optimized for small screens.
	Other statements can execute in the same line. Bug that prevented FILES to work after LOAD has been fixed!
(*) CHAIN [folder_name/]file_name - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD.
(*) LOAD [folder_name/]file_name - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD.
(*) SAVE [folder_name/]file_name - rewritten; now can handle folders on SD. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) LIST [from_line][, to_line] - rewritten, optimized for small screens, added from and to options.
	Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) MEM - refactored, optimized for small screens. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) NEW - changed memory allocation.
(*) DELAY milliseconds - refactored.
(*) AWRITE pin, value - rewritten, now checks pin availability to prevent clash with SD, XMEM, SCREEN.
(*) DWRITE pin, value - rewritten, now accept TRUE and FALSE as values.
(*) TONEW frequency, duration - rewritten.
(*) TONE frequency, duration - rewritten.
(/) NOTONE - unchanged.
(*) EFORMAT - rewritten. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) ELIST - rewritten. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) ECHAIN - rewritten.
(*) ELOAD - rewritten.
(*) ESAVE - rewritten. Other statements can execute in the same line.
(*) RSEED value - rewritten.
(*) RUN - changed running sequence.
(-) LET var = value. LET is useless command. Just use assignments.
        (arguably in IF a<0 LET a=0 may be useful for clarity; need to put THEN ELSE later and the problem
	will go away)
(*) IF expression - refactored.
(*) GOTO line_number - refactored. Negative line numbers are not allowed.
	Computing GOTO, e.g. GOTO 100+10*I is not allowed (results in ugly programming practices).
(*) GOSUB line_number - refactored. Negative line numbers are not allowed.
	Computing GOSUB, e.g. GOSUB 100+10*I is not allowed.
(*) RETURN - reworked stack
(*) REM <any_text>, (also ' <any_text>).
(*) FOR var=<from> TO <to> [STEP <step>] Forces the variable to long.
(*) NEXT var. Forces the variable to long
(*) INPUT var[, question] - rewritten. Now can ask user e.g. INPUT A,"Enter coeff: "; also 
        changed incorrect entry procedure.
(*) PRINT string/expression - rewritten and optimized for small and slow screens.
(*) POKE address, value - rewritten.
(*) PEEK( address) - rewritten.
(-) END - removed as useless (it was a synonim for STOP)
(*) STOP - reworked the program running logic.
(-) BYE - replaced with RESET.
(+) RESET - on microprocessors one cannot leave the system.
(*) ABS(expression) - refactored.
(*) AREAD(pin_number) - refactored.
(*) DREAD(pin_number,pullup) - refactored. Now can set pull-up resistor on the pin.
(-) RND(expression) - replace with RANDOM. This is to prevent confusion with ROUND.
(+) RANDOM(expression) - refactored.
(+) SHOW(line_number) - prints one line, returns address.
(+) DUMP(address, n_bytes) - prints memory dump.
(+) FALSE, LO, LOW, TRUE, HI, HIGH.
(+) PI = 3.14...
(+) EE = 2.71...
(+) SIN(expression)
(+) COS(expression)
(+) TAN(expression)
(+) ASIN(expression)
(+) ACOS(expression)
(+) ATAN(expression)
(+) POW(expression, expression)
(+) SQRT(expression)
(+) SET TMODE {RADIAN, DEGREES, GRADIAN}
